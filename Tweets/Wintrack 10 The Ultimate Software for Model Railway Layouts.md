## How to use Wintrack 10?
 
Wintrack 10 is easy to use even for beginners. You can start by choosing a track system and a scale from the menu. Then you can draw your tracks by clicking on the symbols or using the keyboard shortcuts. You can also use the automatic routing function to connect two points with the optimal track configuration. You can adjust the track height, angle,and length by dragging the mouse or entering values. You can also insert turnouts,crossings,and special elements such as bridges,tunnels,and helixes.
 
To add scenery and structures,you can select from the libraries of 2D and 3D objects. You can drag and drop them on your plan or use the alignment tools to place them precisely. You can also rotate,scale,and edit them as you wish. You can also create your own objects using the 3D editor.
 
To see how your layout looks like in reality,you can switch to the 3D view with one click. You can change the angle of the camera,the light situation,the topography,and different views (tracks, landscape and structures;tracks and benchwork only;tracks only). You can save the 3D view as BMP file or make printouts from it. You can also export the ribs to DXF format for further processing.
